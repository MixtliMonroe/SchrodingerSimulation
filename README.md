# Simulating the Schrodinger equation
In this project I used finite difference methods (especially Runge-Kutta 4) to simulate the time evolution of a spatial wavefunction in a given potential.<br>
This is an older project.

# Tunneling simulation
This is a quick test I did to visualise quantum tunneling. I plotted the spatial probability plot (left) and the spatial complex plot (right), though note that $|\Psi|$ is plotted and not $|\Psi|^{2}$ (for asthetic reasons).

# Wavepacket in an infinite square well simulation
This is a more complicated render showing a wavepacket bouncing back and forth inside an infinite square well. Both probability and complex plots of each spatial and momentum states are plotted, although what I believe is aliasing is prominent in the momentum complex plot.
